## About this repository

This repo contains the code for my [personal site](https://moijes12.github.io) . 

## Why did I build this ?
Earlier I made use of [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to build my site. But I wanted more control of my site. So I learnt some front-end programming using the resources available on [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com) (which I think has great content for learning front-end development). I then built up this single page site slowly with whatever freetime I had.

Big thanks to [shishiranshuman](https://github.com/shishiranshuman) and [Prayag](https://github.com/prayagchoraria) who guided me along the way.
